# Create React App ➕ TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

[Here's a blog post that discusses WTH this is.](https://dev.to/codefinity/cra-ts-tailwind-42c1)

## TLDR

1. Click 'Use This Template'
2. `clone` it to your 💻
3. `cd` into the new directory 📂
4. `npm i` to get all of the 'node_modules' built
5. `npm start`
6. Open this spit up in VS Code
7. **Strongly consider** installing all of the recommended VS Code extensions - you _might_ even want to install [Kite 🪁](https://www.kite.com/) and [Ponicode](https://www.ponicode.com/)
8. Make a 'components' directory and start working 👷🏾‍♂️.

Contributions welcome. No specific guidelines at this point - just common sense - specific tasks, good `commit` messages, etc. Feel free to LMK of any doubts or queries.

I do prefer `commit` messages that use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/). Also, using those sort of helps with 'categorizing' and 'separating' `commit`s appropriately.
